# Maze project

This project was made by a group of students under the mentorship of Stjepan Bogdan with additional help from Assistants Antonella Barišić, Marko Križmančić and Marijana Peti for the fifth semester project on FER (fer.hr) 
Files include all the test files we used as well as the simulink simulation files.

# Description

The task was to navigate a Sphero robot through the maze using the image received from autonomous drone flying over the maze.
Whole documentation is available in Croatian.

To use the files you need to implement them in a ROS workspace with additional ROS drivers:
